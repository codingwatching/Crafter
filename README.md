# Crafter

> What is this?

Crafter originally started as a Minetest game.

It was ported to various languages with varying levels of success in this order:

1. Lua with LOVR
2. Go with G3N
3. C
4. C++
5. Java with LWJGL 3

The final one, Java, went pretty well. But due to Java's verbosity, strong OOP, complex development integration, null unsafety, memory unsafety, FFI C performance, and cumbersome nature it killed my interest in game development for a bit. 

That's when I looked back into Rust got incredibly frustrated, then slowly understood and enjoyed it. This is where the current project stands. I am working hard to port my Java code into Rust and fix a LOT of issues with the Java implementation.
